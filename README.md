# ClippySync

ClippySync is a command-line tool that allows you to sync clipboards across multiple machines on the same network. With ClippySync, you can easily share clipboard content between your devices, making it convenient to transfer text, links, or any other clipboard data seamlessly.

## Why ClippySync?

As the author of ClippySync, I developed this tool to address a personal need for clipboard syncing across multiple machines. In my setup, I use Sunshine and Moonlight for desktop sharing, which works great but lacks a built-in mechanism for clipboard sharing. ClippySync fills this gap by providing a seamless way to share clipboard content between devices.

ClippySync is not limited to my specific use case, however. It can be beneficial in various situations where clipboard sharing is not natively supported by remote desktop software. If you find yourself frequently needing to transfer text, links, or other clipboard data between machines, ClippySync can be a valuable tool in your workflow.

One notable aspect of ClippySync's development is the involvement of artificial intelligence (AI). Much of the code for this program was generated with the assistance of AI, using careful prompting and guidance from the author. As an experienced Python developer, I thoroughly reviewed, tested, and debugged the AI-generated code to ensure its functionality and reliability. In this sense, AI served as a powerful tool to expedite the development process while maintaining the necessary human oversight and expertise.

Whether you're using remote desktop software that lacks clipboard sharing or simply need a convenient way to sync clipboards across your devices, ClippySync provides a straightforward solution. Its development showcases the potential of AI-assisted coding, demonstrating how AI can be leveraged to accelerate software development while still relying on human knowledge and judgment to ensure the final product meets the desired standards.
